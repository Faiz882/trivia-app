# Trivia app

I am trying to cover 2 things

1) MVVM Pattern with retrofit to get questions from server.
2) MVVM Pattern, Coroutines and room to insert record in local db.
-> Both mode working fine  

My Question

1) unclearity with points if user choose a wrong answer then what happened with points? for now i am just increasing points
either correct or incorrect
2) why user can't see his/her results ? how user know about correct answer? there is only localDb which is only for developer
3) in quick mode if user does not select any option i am saving 1st option by default
